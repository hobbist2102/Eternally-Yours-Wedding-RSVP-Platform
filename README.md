A comprehensive wedding management platform tailored for Indian weddings, providing robust event-specific management with isolated data storage and granular control over event details.

## üéØ Project Purpose

The Indian Wedding Management Platform is designed to help wedding agencies and planners manage complex Indian wedding events efficiently. Indian weddings often involve multiple ceremonies, large guest lists, and intricate logistics spanning several days. This platform provides a centralized system for managing:

- Guest lists with RSVP tracking
- Multiple ceremony scheduling
- Accommodation and travel logistics
- WhatsApp communication
- Reporting and analytics

The platform supports both client-facing (couple) and backend (agency staff) interfaces, ensuring all stakeholders can access the information they need.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Backend
- **TypeScript/Node.js**: Strong typing with Express framework
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Relational database with tenant-based isolation
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database queries and schema management
- **RESTful API**: Clean API architecture for frontend communication

### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based UI library
- **TanStack Query (React Query)**: Data fetching and cache management
- **shadcn/ui & Tailwind CSS**: Component library and utility-first CSS
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe client-side code

### Security & Authentication
- **Session-based Authentication**: Secure session management
- **Event-level Data Isolation**: Multi-tenant architecture with strict data boundaries

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- PostgreSQL database
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/indian-wedding-management.git
cd indian-wedding-management
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/wedding_management
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
```

4. Run database migrations
```bash
npm run db:push

```

## üíæ Data Model

The platform uses a multi-tenant data architecture with the following key models:

- **Users**: Agency staff and system administrators
- **Events**: Wedding events with metadata
- **Guests**: Comprehensive guest information with event association
- **Ceremonies**: Individual ceremonies within a wedding event
- **Accommodations**: Lodging options for guests
- **Travel**: Transportation details for guests
- **WhatsApp Templates**: Message templates for guest communication

### Data Isolation Strategy

All data is isolated at the event level using an event ID as a tenant identifier. This approach ensures complete data separation between different wedding projects while maintaining a single database.

## üõ£Ô∏è Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality ‚úÖ
- Authentication and user management
- Event creation and basic configuration
- Guest list management and import/export
- Basic dashboard and reporting

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features üîÑ
- Ceremony management
- Travel and accommodation planning
- WhatsApp integration
- Advanced reporting

### Phase 3: Client-Facing Portal üìÖ
- Couple access portal
- Guest self-service RSVP system
- Mobile optimization
- Real-time updates

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Query Caching Strategy
The application implements a sophisticated caching strategy using TanStack Query to ensure proper data isolation between events:

- Cache is completely cleared when switching between events
- Reduced staleTime to ensure fresh data when switching contexts
- Comprehensive query invalidation for related data
- Event context included in query keys for proper isolation

### Event Context Management
The platform uses session-based event context tracking with validation at both client and server:

- Server-side verification of event context on all API requests
- Client-side hooks for consistent access to the current event
- Defensive programming to prevent cross-event data leakage
