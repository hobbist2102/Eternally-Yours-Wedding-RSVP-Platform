## Technical Debt & Refactoring Areas
1. **Route organization**: Consolidate and organize route handlers by feature
2. **Type safety**: Enhance TypeScript types across the application
3. **Test coverage**: Implement unit and integration tests
4. ✓ **Error handling**: Standardized error handling through consolidated API utilities
5. ✓ **Code modularization**: Refactored components for better modularity:
   - ✓ Consolidated date formatting utilities
   - ✓ Reusable table components with DataTable
   - ✓ Centralized API request handling
6. **Performance optimization**: Address any slow data operations or UI rendering
7. **Accessibility**: Ensure all components meet WCAG standards

## Development Best Practices
To ensure consistent and high-quality development:

1. **Consistent code style**: Use ESLint and Prettier with strict rules
2. **Component-based approach**: Build reusable, well-documented components
3. **Progressive enhancement**: Ensure core functionality works before adding advanced features
4. **Mobile-first design**: Design for mobile first, then enhance for larger screens
5. **Type safety**: Use TypeScript strictly with no implicit any types
6. **Testing**: Write tests for critical functionality
7. **Documentation**: Document APIs, components, and complex processes
8. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for all user interfaces
9. **Performance**: Regularly audit and optimize performance
10. **Security**: Follow security best practices, especially for auth and data access

## Implementation Priorities
To ensure efficient development that aligns with business needs:

1. **RSVP functionality**: Complete the core RSVP flow first as it's the primary value
2. **Communication channels**: Ensure reliable email and messaging channels
3. **Guest management**: Enhance guest tracking and relationship mapping
4. **Accommodation tracking**: Implement hotel and travel management
5. **Reporting**: Build reporting tools for decision-making
6. **Advanced features**: Add enhancements once core functionality is stable

## Future Considerations
- Mobile application for on-the-go management
- Advanced AI for guest suggestions and planning
- Integration with calendar and collaboration tools
- Multi-language support for international weddings
- Payment integration for guest contributions or vendor payments
- Advanced analytics and predictive modeling

By following this roadmap and consistently checking it against the detailed user flows, the development process will be more structured, efficient, and aligned with actual user needs.
