## Section 1: Overall Review
### Project Summary
The **Indian Wedding Management Platform** is designed to streamline the management of complex Indian wedding events. The platform supports multi-event management, robust guest tracking, ceremony logistics, and automated communication through both email and WhatsApp integration.

### Key Features
1. Multi-event management with tenant-based data isolation
2. Comprehensive guest tracking and RSVP management
3. Ceremony and accommodation planning tools
4. WhatsApp Business integration for personalized communication
5. Dynamic RSVP follow-up with multi-channel communication
6. Event-specific OAuth configuration for email services

### Strengths
- Well-structured backend using TypeScript, Express, and Drizzle ORM
- Modular frontend architecture with React, TanStack Query, and TailwindCSS
- Strong focus on multi-tenancy and security
- Flexible communication system with multiple channels (email, WhatsApp)

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Error Handling**:
   - Enhance server-side error handling for API endpoints
   - Add user-friendly error messages for common issues
2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize database queries to handle large guest lists efficiently
   - Implement lazy loading for frontend components
3. **Testing**:
   - Increase test coverage for critical components and APIs
   - Add automated tests for utility functions and backend routes
4. **Documentation**:
   - Improve inline code documentation for complex functions
   - Add more comprehensive user guides for complex features

## Section 2: Recent Improvements

### 1. Enhanced OAuth Implementation
- **Description**: Implemented event-specific OAuth credentials for Gmail and Outlook email services
- **Status**: Completed
- **Impact**: Enables per-event customization of email providers and credentials
- **Details**:
  - Added database fields for storing OAuth credentials at the event level
  - Implemented fallback mechanism to environment variables when event-specific credentials are unavailable
  - Enhanced the RsvpFollowupConfiguration UI with clear instructions and visual guidance
  - Added comprehensive documentation for the OAuth implementation in `docs/OAUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### 2. UI Improvements for Configuration Screens
- **Description**: Enhanced the configuration UI for email and communication settings
- **Status**: Completed
- **Impact**: Improves user experience and reduces setup errors
- **Details**:
  - Added step-by-step configuration guidance for OAuth setup
  - Improved button styling and visual indicators for connection status
  - Enhanced error messaging for configuration issues
  - Created consistent UI patterns across different configuration screens

### 3. Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
- **Description**: Implemented robust event-level data isolation
- **Status**: Partially Complete
- **Impact**: Ensures complete separation of data between different wedding events
- **Details**:
  - Added event context validation to critical RSVP and guest management routes
  - Implemented context-aware database access methods
  - Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/MULTI_TENANT_ISOLATION.md`
  - Remaining work includes applying isolation to travel, accommodation, and reporting endpoints

## Section 3: Issue Tracking and Suggestions

### Issue 1: Guest List Appearing Across Events
- **Description**: Guests created in one event (e.g., "Rocky Rani") appear in other events (e.g., "Virat and Anu")
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Impact**: Previously caused data leakage and violated tenant-based data isolation
- **Fix Implemented**:
  1. **Backend**:
     - Updated the `/api/events/:eventId/guests` endpoint to filter guests by `eventId`
     - Implemented event context validation across all guest management routes
     - Created context-aware method `getGuestWithEventContext` for secure guest retrieval

  2. **Frontend**:
     - Updated `useQuery` calls to include event context in query keys
     - Added validation to ensure event context is present for all guest operations

### Issue 2: OAuth Configuration UI
- **Description**: The RsvpFollowupConfiguration component lacked clear instructions and UI guidance for setting up OAuth
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Impact**: Users struggled to properly configure Gmail and Outlook integration
- **Fix Implemented**:
  1. **UI Enhancements**:
     - Added clear step-by-step instruction panels for both Gmail and Outlook
     - Improved button styling to highlight unconfigured services
     - Enhanced visual indicators to show connection status

  2. **Documentation**:
     - Created comprehensive OAuth implementation documentation
     - Added inline comments to explain complex OAuth flows

### Issue 3: Database Schema TypeScript Inconsistencies
- **Description**: Several TypeScript errors in `storage.ts` due to type mismatches
- **Status**: Open
- **Impact**: Reduces code quality and may lead to runtime errors
- **Recommended Fix**:
  - Review and align all TypeScript types with the database schema
  - Fix all TypeScript errors related to date handling, optional properties, and promises
  - Implement consistent type patterns across the codebase
