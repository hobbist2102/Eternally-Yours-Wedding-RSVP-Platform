Copilot said: It seems that the issues identified in
It seems that the issues identified in the project_review.txt file have already been addressed in your recent changes. Based on your detailed comparison, you have implemented robust solutions that go beyond the suggestions made in the review. Here's a summary of your confirmation:

Implemented Fixes

Backend

Server-side filtering by eventId is already in place.
Your getGuestsByEvent function ensures proper isolation of guest data.
Frontend

React Query enhancements:
staleTime set to 0 to ensure fresh data.
refetchOnMount: true for consistent data refresh.
Event context added to query keys.
Comprehensive cache management, including queryClient.clear() and query invalidations.
Validation

Server-side validation for missing or invalid eventId is already implemented.
Relevant API endpoints enforce strict validation and return appropriate error messages.
Conclusion

Your implementation is more comprehensive and robust compared to the original recommendations. There is no need for further action based on the initial review of the Guest List Appearing Across Events issue. However, keeping the project_review.txt file updated with these findings and marking the issue as resolved would be beneficial for future tracking.

Would you like me to update the project_review.txt file to reflect that this issue is resolved and include your detailed comparisons? This will ensure the file remains a reliable source of truth for your project. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

Copilot said: If the issue of guests appearing across
If the issue of guests appearing across events persists despite the fixes being implemented, here are some possible reasons and areas to investigate further:

1. Data Integrity in the Database

Problem: The database might already have incorrect or duplicate data that assigns guests to the wrong event.
Solution:
Run a query to check if multiple eventIds are associated with the same guest.
Example query:
SQL
SELECT *
FROM guests
WHERE guest_id IN (
  SELECT guest_id
  FROM guests
  GROUP BY guest_id
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) > 1
);
If such data exists, clean up the database to ensure each guest is correctly linked to a single event.
2. Frontend Caching Issues

Problem: The frontend may still be displaying stale or cached data from previous events.
Solution:
Confirm that all relevant queries are invalidated when switching events.
Ensure the queryClient.clear() or invalidateQueries() logic is applied consistently for all guest-related data.
3. Backend API Misbehavior

Problem: The backend API may not be enforcing event scoping in all endpoints.
Solution:
Verify that all guest-related endpoints (e.g., create, update, delete, fetch) include eventId in their logic.
Test endpoints individually to ensure they are filtering guests by eventId.
4. Concurrency Issues

Problem: Inconsistent state caused by concurrent API calls or unexpected race conditions.
Solution:
Ensure backend operations are atomic and handle concurrent requests properly.
Lock database rows or use transactions to prevent conflicting updates.
5. Unexpected Frontend Behavior

Problem: UI components may be rendering data incorrectly (e.g., due to incorrect filtering or merging of lists).
Solution:
Debug the frontend to confirm that the guests displayed are based on the current eventId context.
Add logging to the data-fetching hooks to verify that the correct queryKey and eventId are being used.
6. Cross-Event Guests

Problem: Some guests might be intentionally linked to multiple events (e.g., family members attending multiple ceremonies).
Solution:
If this is expected behavior, add additional logic to explicitly handle and display cross-event guests.
Suggested Next Steps

Database Audit:

Check for data integrity issues and fix any incorrect associations between guests and events.
Frontend Debugging:

Add logging to the frontend to confirm the correct eventId is being used for all queries and UI components.
Backend Testing:

Test all guest-related endpoints to ensure they enforce event scoping correctly.
