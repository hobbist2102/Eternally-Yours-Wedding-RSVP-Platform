Objective
Create a centralized Event Settings Page for the Wedding RSVP project to manage settings for all modules (current and future). These include:

OAuth Configuration (Gmail, Outlook)
RSVP settings (Invitations, Follow-ups)
Travel and Accommodation (for future modules)
This page will ensure that all event-related settings are housed in one unified interface, improving usability and scalability.

Tasks
Backend

Create a new API endpoint (/api/events/:eventId/settings) to fetch and update all event-related settings (OAuth, RSVP, Travel, Accommodation).
Refactor existing routes (e.g., /api/events/:eventId/oauth-config) to integrate with the new unified endpoint.
Ensure modularity so additional modules can be added easily.
Frontend

Add a new EventSettingsPage component with tabs or a sidebar for:
OAuth Configuration
RSVP Settings (Invitations & Follow-ups)
Travel and Accommodation (future-ready)
Reuse existing components where possible but ensure consistent styling and UX improvements:
Add tooltips for technical fields like clientId and clientSecret.
Provide visual indicators for connection status (e.g., Gmail/Outlook connected).
Add placeholders for future modules (Travel, Accommodation) with "Coming Soon" messages.
Database

Verify that all settings (OAuth, RSVP, etc.) are stored in the database.
If any settings rely on environment variables, migrate them to the database for event-specific customization.
Testing

Write unit and integration tests for the new API endpoint and frontend components.
Ensure edge cases like missing settings, invalid inputs, and expired tokens are handled.
Documentation

Update the project documentation to include:
Instructions for accessing and managing settings via the new Event Settings Page.
API usage examples for the new endpoint.
Details on how to add future modules to the settings page.
Deliverables
A new Event Settings Page in the frontend with tabs/sections for all modules.
A unified backend API for managing event settings.
Updated database schema (if needed) and migration scripts.
Tests and documentation for the new functionality.
