Fix Gmail and Outlook Integration
The current implementation of the "Configure" buttons for Gmail and Outlook in the RSVP Follow-Up Communication settings is incomplete. When clicking the "Configure" button:

A mock email (e.g., wedding@gmail.com) is added without any actual authentication.
No popup or redirect to Google's or Microsoft's OAuth login page is displayed.
No passwords or real authentication are requested.
Expected Behavior:
OAuth Authentication Flow:

Clicking the "Configure" button for Gmail should:
Redirect users to Google's OAuth login page.
Allow users to grant access to their Gmail account for sending emails.
Clicking the "Configure" button for Outlook should:
Redirect users to Microsoft's OAuth login page.
Allow users to grant access to their Outlook account for sending emails.
Token Management:

After successful authentication, retrieve and store the access token securely in the backend.
Use the token to send emails through Gmail or Outlook APIs.
Implement token refresh logic to handle expired tokens.
UI Update After Successful Configuration:

Display the authenticated email address (e.g., user@gmail.com or user@outlook.com) in the UI.
Replace the "Configure" button with a "Reconfigure" or "Disconnect" button.
Error Handling:

Show appropriate error messages if the authentication fails or the user cancels the process.
Tasks to Implement:
Frontend Changes:

Update the "Configure" button to initiate the OAuth flow for Gmail and Outlook.
Handle the redirection back to the application after authentication.
Update the UI to display the authenticated email address and provide options to reconfigure or disconnect the account.
Backend Changes:

Implement OAuth endpoints for Gmail and Outlook:
Gmail: Use Google's OAuth 2.0 API to handle authentication and token exchange.
Outlook: Use Microsoft's OAuth 2.0 API for the same purpose.
Securely store and manage OAuth tokens in the backend.
Add functionality to refresh tokens when they expire.
Testing:

Test the OAuth flow for both Gmail and Outlook with real accounts.
Verify that emails can be sent successfully using the authenticated accounts.
Additional Notes:
Ensure the OAuth flow works seamlessly across different browsers and devices.
Provide a detailed success message after configuration, including the authenticated email address.
