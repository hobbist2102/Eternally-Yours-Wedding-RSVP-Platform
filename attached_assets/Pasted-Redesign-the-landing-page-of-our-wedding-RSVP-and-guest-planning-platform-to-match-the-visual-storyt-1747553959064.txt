Redesign the landing page of our wedding RSVP and guest planning platform to match the visual storytelling quality, scroll behavior, and immersive experience of:

1. https://cornrevolution.resn.global/#science – for its full-screen scroll-driven animations, cinematic pacing, and section-by-section storytelling.
2. https://eiger-extreme.mammut.com/en – for its sticky top navigation, clean transitions, and intuitive layout.

Objective:
Create a landing page that scrolls like a guided experience or product story. The goal is to make users feel they are being taken on a journey from the problems planners face → to the effortless simplicity of using our app.

The entire landing page should feel cinematic, fluid, and emotionally engaging — while also clearly explaining the app’s features.

Scroll Story Structure (each full-screen section = 1 scroll step):

1. **The Chaos Planners Hide**  
   Visual: Show digital clutter — messy WhatsApp threads, spreadsheets, manual coordination  
   Tagline: “The ceremony is beautiful. The backend is broken.”

2. **The Breakthrough**  
   Visual: Scene clears to reveal a clean RSVP UI and WhatsApp chat  
   Tagline: “The most elegant RSVP you’ll never have to explain.”

3. **2-Stage RSVP**  
   Visual: Show a two-part RSVP flow — attendance + travel info  
   Tagline: “From invite to itinerary. In two steps.”

4. **AI Concierge + WhatsApp**  
   Visual: Chatbot helping guests and planners in real-time  
   Tagline: “One message. Infinite coordination.”

5. **Room Assignment Automation**  
   Visual: Rooms assigned based on RSVP travel data  
   Tagline: “Match. Approve. Move on.”

6. **Transport Planning**  
   Visual: Guests grouped by shuttle pickup and arrival timing  
   Tagline: “Arrival time becomes pickup time. Automatically.”

7. **Planner Command Center**  
   Visual: Show an intelligent dashboard with RSVP %, rooms, transport  
   Tagline: “From 300 guests to one screen.”

8. **Testimonials / Social Proof**  
   Visual: Real planner testimonials with light animation  
   Tagline: “They didn’t need tech. Until this.”

9. **Final CTA – Start on WhatsApp**  
   Visual: WhatsApp interface opens, showing “Are you attending?” → “Yes”  
   Tagline: “Your event starts where your guests already are.”

The top navigation should remain fixed with smooth anchor links to each section:
Story / Features / AI / WhatsApp / Rooms / Transport / Demo

The final result should feel premium, modern, emotional, and story-led — like a digital product teaser or brand film you scroll through.

Avoid traditional home page layouts — focus on visual transitions, scroll interactions, and immersive flow.
