I've been testing the application and would like to share some updates, successes, and enhancement suggestions.

Successes Logged:
Event Creation:

Successfully created multiple events with proper isolation for data between them.
Event switching works as expected, redirecting appropriately without conflicts.
Guest Management:

Successfully created guests in different events with proper scoping.
Guests are isolated to their respective events and do not appear in unrelated event data.
RSVP Testing:

The RSVP form is functional, and initial responses can be captured correctly.
Guest creation and isolation are working as intended.
Enhancements for RSVP Flow:
1. Split RSVP into Two Stages:
To simplify and streamline the RSVP process, we propose splitting it into two stages:

Stage 1: Initial RSVP Form

Focus on collecting essential attendance details:
Attendance Confirmation: Yes/No.
Plus One Details: Option to add a plus one name (if applicable).
Dietary Preferences: Collect dietary restrictions or allergies.
Event Selection: Allow guests to select which events they will attend.
Local vs. Outstation Guests: Allow guests to confirm if they are local or outstation, impacting later fields dynamically.
Stage 2: Follow-Up RSVP (For Confirmed Guests Only)

Triggered only for guests who confirm attendance in Stage 1.
Collect detailed information based on event settings:
Accommodation:
Options:
Provide accommodation for all outstation guests.
Guests manage their own accommodation.
Special deals with hotels (hotel names, links, contact details).
Provide accommodation for selected guests (dropdown: Accommodation Provided or Manage Own Accommodation).
Automatically exclude local guests from accommodation-related fields.
Transport:
Options:
Provide transport for all outstation guests.
Guests manage their own transport.
Special arrangements with transport providers (details of providers).
Provide transport for selected guests (dropdown: Transport Provided or Manage Own Transport).
Allow guests to provide details based on arrival modes (flight, train, bus, road).
Flight Details:
Options:
Provide flights for all outstation guests.
Guests arrange their own flights.
Special deals with airlines (airline names, links, contact details).
Provide flights for selected guests (dropdown: Flights Provided or Manage Own Flights).
Capture preferred departure and return dates/times and airport preferences.
2. RSVP Form Enhancements:
Message from the Couple/Family:
Add a customizable section in the RSVP form for a personal message from the couple or family (e.g., gratitude, instructions, or special notes).
Auto-Populate Guest Information:
Fields like Email, First Name, and Last Name should be auto-filled based on the guest data provided by the couple.
Allow guests to edit these fields to correct any inaccuracies or provide updates.

Stage 1: Attendance confirmation and basic details.
Stage 2: Detailed accommodation, transport, and flight information for confirmed guests.
RSVP Form Enhancements:

Add a Message from the Couple/Family section.
Implement auto-population of guest information fields with editable options.
Log Successes:

Log the successes in event creation, guest isolation, and RSVP functionality as completed milestones.
