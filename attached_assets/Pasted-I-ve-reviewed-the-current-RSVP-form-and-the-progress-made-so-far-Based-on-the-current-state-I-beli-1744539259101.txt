I’ve reviewed the current RSVP form and the progress made so far. Based on the current state, I believe we should focus on completing the two-step RSVP process first before implementing the communication system. This will allow us to finalize the core functionality and test it thoroughly before moving to guest-specific testing via email or WhatsApp.

Progress So Far:
Event Switching:

Event isolation and switching issues have been resolved.
Enhancements to the useCurrentEvent hook and client-server synchronization were successfully implemented and tested.
RSVP Enhancements:

Schema definitions for the two-stage RSVP flow have been created (rsvp-schema.ts).
The server-side RSVP service has been enhanced with methods for handling Stage 1 (basic attendance) and Stage 2 (travel and accommodation details).
New API endpoints for the two-stage flow have been added.
Client-side components for Stage 1 (rsvp-stage1-form.tsx) and Stage 2 (rsvp-stage2-form.tsx) have been developed.
A combined page (rsvp-page.tsx) managing transitions between Stage 1 and Stage 2 has been created.
Challenges Overcome:

Issues with restarting the server due to port conflicts have been resolved.
Import errors in the RSVP routes file were fixed by updating the RSVPResponseSchema path.
Next Steps: Complete the Two-Step RSVP Process
To finalize the RSVP functionality, we need to focus on the following tasks:

1. Finalize Stage 1 Form (Attendance Confirmation):
Ensure the form collects:
Attendance confirmation (Yes/No).
Event selection.
Dietary preferences.
Plus one details (if applicable).
Validate data submission and ensure proper communication with the backend.
2. Develop and Test Stage 2 Form (Travel and Accommodation):
Ensure the form collects:
Accommodation Details: Room preferences, whether accommodation is provided or self-managed.
Transport Details: Arrival modes (flight, train, bus, road), pickup/drop-off preferences.
Flight Details: Departure/return dates and airport preferences.
Dynamically adjust fields based on:
Event settings (e.g., accommodation provided for all vs. selected guests).
Guest type (e.g., local guests skip accommodation and transport fields).
3. Dynamic Behavior Across Both Stages:
Ensure fields dynamically adapt based on:
Guest type (local vs. outstation).
Previous responses (e.g., only show Stage 2 for confirmed attendees).
Validate seamless transitions between Stage 1 and Stage 2.
4. Couple’s Message Section:
Add functionality for guests to:
Enter a text message for the couple.
Attach an image or video (optional).
Plan for Communication System:
After completing the two-step RSVP process, we can focus on:

Adding email and WhatsApp integration for sending guest-specific invitations and reminders.
Testing the full end-to-end flow as an actual guest, including:
Auto-population of guest information in RSVP forms.
Notifications for follow-ups (e.g., reminders to complete Stage 2).
Request:
Prioritize finalizing the two-step RSVP process by implementing and thoroughly testing both Stage 1 and Stage 2 forms, as outlined above.
Ensure dynamic behavior and data transitions between the two stages are working as intended.
Once complete, move on to implementing the communication module for guest-specific testing.
Let me know once the two-step process is finalized, and I’ll be ready to test it thoroughly before proceeding to the communication system.

Thank you
