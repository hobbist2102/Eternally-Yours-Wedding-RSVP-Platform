We need to enhance the RSVP system to include dynamic follow-up communication based on a guest's RSVP response. This will ensure the system is more engaging and personal. Below are the updated requirements:

Dynamic Follow-Up Communication for RSVP Responses
1. Purpose:
To automatically send personalized messages to guests as a follow-up after they submit their RSVP.
These messages will acknowledge their response and express gratitude or regret in a thoughtful manner.
2. Required Functionality:
Message Types:

Thank-You Message (Yes):
Sent to guests who confirm their attendance.
Example: "Thank you for confirming! We’re so excited to celebrate with you on our special day. Let us know if you have any preferences or needs."
Regret Message (No):
Sent to guests who decline the invitation.
Example: "We’re sorry you can’t make it, but we completely understand. You’ll be missed, and we hope to celebrate together in the future!"
Scheduling Options:

Messages should be sent automatically as soon as the RSVP is submitted or scheduled for a later time (e.g., the same day or a specific date).
Customization Options:

Allow the couple to customize the thank-you and regret messages in the RSVP Configuration Screen.
Optionally, allow the couple to preview the messages before saving.
3. Guest Experience:
Guests will:
Submit their RSVP form.
Receive a follow-up message via their selected communication channel (email/WhatsApp) based on their response.
Feel acknowledged and valued regardless of their RSVP decision.
4. Integration with Communication Module:
Messages should be sent through the existing communication channels (email and WhatsApp).
Ensure the follow-up messages are visually appealing and formatted correctly for each channel.
Next Steps for Implementation
1. Update RSVP Configuration Screen:
Add fields for the couple to:
Customize the thank-you and regret messages.
Schedule the messages (immediate or specific date/time).
Preview how the messages will appear to guests.
2. Automate Follow-Up Communication:
Integrate the thank-you and regret messages into the communication module.
Ensure messages are triggered automatically or scheduled based on the couple's preferences.
3. Test End-to-End Flow:
Validate that:
Messages are sent correctly based on guest responses.
Scheduled messages are sent at the specified time.
The guest experience is seamless across all communication channels.
Request:
Implement the dynamic follow-up communication feature as outlined above.
Update the RSVP Configuration Screen to include message customization and scheduling options.
Let me know once the feature is ready for testing, and I’ll review it thoroughly.
