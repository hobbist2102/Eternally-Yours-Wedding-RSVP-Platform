We need to prioritize the Update RSVP Configuration UI task first, ensuring the UI reflects the new follow-up communication features. After that, focus on completing the communication module with integration requirements for Gmail/Outlook and SendGrid, as well as event-specific WhatsApp numbers and email IDs. Below are the updated requirements:

1. Update RSVP Configuration UI
Purpose:
To provide an intuitive interface for customizing RSVP follow-up messages and managing event-specific communication settings.

Required Changes:
Follow-Up Message Customization:

Add fields to customize thank-you and regret messages for each event.
Include a preview option to allow the couple or event manager to see how messages will appear to guests.
Scheduling Options:

Allow the couple to choose whether follow-up messages are sent:
Immediately after RSVP submission.
At a scheduled date and time.
Event-Specific Settings:

Ensure messages can be configured separately for each event (e.g., Wedding Day, Reception, etc.).
Support customization of:
Email IDs for communication.
WhatsApp phone numbers for sending messages.
2. Complete Communication Module
Once the RSVP Configuration UI is updated, focus on integrating the communication module. Below are the requirements and considerations:

Email Integration:
Primary Approach:
Integrate Gmail and Outlook for email communication.
Use the email IDs provided for each event in the RSVP Configuration UI.
Include personalization in email templates (e.g., guest name, RSVP status).
Email Sending Limits:
Gmail: Free accounts support 500 emails/day; Google Workspace supports 2,000 emails/day.
Outlook: Free accounts support 300 emails/day; Microsoft 365 supports 10,000 emails/day.
These limits are sufficient for our use case.
Fallback Option:
Integrate SendGrid to handle overflow or large-scale email communication needs.
Use SendGridâ€™s free tier (100 emails/day) initially and upgrade if needed.
WhatsApp Integration:
Event-Specific WhatsApp Numbers:
Allow each event to have its own WhatsApp number for sending follow-up messages.
Ensure the UI supports assigning a unique WhatsApp number to each event.
Message Templates:
Support personalized thank-you and regret messages for WhatsApp.
Test formatting and delivery to ensure compatibility across devices.
3. Questions to Address
Gmail/Outlook Integration:

Are there any challenges with integrating Gmail or Outlook for email communication (e.g., OAuth setup, rate limits)?
If Gmail/Outlook is not feasible for certain use cases, SendGrid will act as a fallback.
Multiple WhatsApp Numbers:

How should we handle assigning and managing different WhatsApp numbers for each event?
Are there any technical limitations we need to account for?
Scalability:

Will the system be able to scale for large events with high RSVP volumes?
Are there additional features we should consider to future-proof the communication module?
Next Steps
Update the RSVP Configuration UI:

Add customization fields for follow-up messages.
Include event-specific settings for email IDs and WhatsApp numbers.
Implement preview and scheduling options.
Complete the Communication Module:

Integrate Gmail/Outlook for email communication with OAuth authentication.
Add SendGrid as a fallback for large-scale email communication.
Add support for multiple WhatsApp numbers and email IDs for different events.
Test dynamic follow-up messages across both email and WhatsApp.
Address Open Questions:

Confirm the feasibility of Gmail/Outlook integration.
Finalize the approach for managing event-specific WhatsApp numbers.
Please prioritize the RSVP Configuration UI updates first. Once that is complete, proceed with the communication module as outlined above. Let us know if further clarification is needed!
